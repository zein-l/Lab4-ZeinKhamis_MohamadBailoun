Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
Tkinter Module: Tkinter is usually included with Python. If not, you may need to install it separately.

Navigate to the Application Directory:

Open a terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where Part2.py (the Tkinter application) is located:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/application

Run the Application:

Execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python Part2.py
If python points to Python 2.x on your system, use python3 instead:

bash
Copy code
python3 Part2.py
Start Using the Application:

The School Management System GUI should now open, and you can begin managing students, instructors, and courses.
