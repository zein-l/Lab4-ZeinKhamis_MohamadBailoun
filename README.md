Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
Tkinter Module: Tkinter is usually included with Python. If not, you may need to install it separately.

Steps to Run the Application
Navigate to the Application Directory:

Open a terminal or command prompt and change to the directory where Part2.py (the Tkinter application) is located:

cd Lab4-ZeinKhamis_MohamadBailoun/tkinter_application/

Run the Application:

Execute the following command:

python Part2.py

Or if you have Python3 installed:

python3 Part2.py

The School Management System GUI should now open, and you can begin managing students, instructors, and courses.

Note: Ensure that any required files (Part1.py, Part4.py, etc.) are in the same directory as Part2.py.
